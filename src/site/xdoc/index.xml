    <section name="About Model">
      <p>The Model compoment provides tools to generate DM documents and other artifacts
        from ontologies generated by <a href='http://protege.stanford.edu/'>Protégé</a>.
        This enables data dictionary and ontology designers to share the changing
        morphology of the PDS model with the rest of the PDS nodes and the general
        public.
      </p>
