    <section name="Operation">
      <p>This document describes how to run the LDDTool program. 
      </p>

      <p>Note: The command-line examples in this section have been broken into multiple lines for readability. The commands should be reassembled into a single line prior to execution.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section name="Tool Execution">
<p>The execution steps are as follows:</p>
   <ol>
       <li>The input XML document is parsed and the contents are validated against the master database.</li>
      <li>The validated contents are integrated into the master database.</li>
      <li>The XML Schema and Schematron files are written.</li>
      <li>The process report and spreadsheet are written.</li>
   </ol>

      <subsection name="Command-Line Options">
        <p>The following table describes the command-line options available.

      <subsection name="Execute LDDTool">
<source>
<b>If the host platform is a Mac or Unix system, type the following commands: </b>

cd  ./lddtool-${project.version}/bin

lddtool -lp [inputfilename] > lddtool.log

<b>If the host platform is a Windows system, type the following commands: </b>

cd .\lddtool-${project.version}\bin

lddtool.bat -lp [inputfilename] > lddtool.log

<b>Note:</b>  The input file to LDDTool is an XML document that contains a completed
       local data dictionary template. This file must conform to the
       PDS4 Ingest_LDDTool schema.

       The output files written by LDDTool are:
                  - an XML Schema file (.xsd),
                  - a Schematron file (.sch),
                  - a process report file (.txt),
                  - a spreadsheet file (.csv) containing the local data dictionary information.
       All output files are generated in the current directory. 
       They bear the same name as the input file name unless the -s command option is used.  
       The -s option causes the local namespace + information model version to be used as the output file names.
       Check out the directory - "./Examples/Standard_Example" which contains an example input file and a set of output files.
